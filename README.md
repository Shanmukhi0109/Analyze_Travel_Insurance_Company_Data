# Analyze_Travel_Insurance_Company_Data

Problem Statement:

Due to the COVID pandemic, they have had to cut their marketing budget by over 50%. It is more important than ever that they advertise in the right places and to the right people.Travel Assured has plenty of data on their current customers as well as people who got quotes but never bought insurance. They want to know if there are differences in the travel habits between customers and non-customers - they believe they are more likely to travel often (buying tickets from frequent flyer miles) and travel abroad. They would be interested in any other insights you can find that might help the marketing strategy.
